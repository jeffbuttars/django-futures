Install
=======

**The current version of Django Futures is a development build!**

Django Futures is still a proof of concept. That said, please install it,
try it, and give feedback.

There is package available and is the easiest way to install Django
Futures. Simply install with ``pip`` as usual.

::


    pip install djang-futures


If you prefer the bleeding edge, install using the sources from
`GitHub <https://github.com/jeffbuttars/django-futures>`_.

``pip`` can also be used to install from source.

1. Clone the repo: ``git clone https://github.com/jeffbuttars/django-futures``
2. ``pip`` the package sources: ``pip install django-futures/src``

If you don't want to use ``pip``, you can run the setup script directly.
Clone the directory as in step one above then:

2. Change to the package source directory: ``cd django-futures/src``
3. Run the ``setup.py`` script: ``python ./setup.py install``
